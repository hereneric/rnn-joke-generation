# rnn-joke-generation
Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for RNN joke generation in Python using TensorFlow.

Mostly reused code from [word-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow), which is based on https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

# Data
Some of the data are reused from https://github.com/brendansudol/rnn-joke-generate.

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org)
